 *    This function is called when a radio is initialized.

 *    During the initialization the parsed preset is copied

 *    set to its initial state.
 *
 *    Type of Event:
 *        Data
 *    Event:
 *        initializeComponent
 *    Event raised by:
 *        - Uninitialized Radio is in invetory of player
 *
 *     Parsed parameters:
 *        0:    Radio ID
 *        1:    Event (-> "initializeComponent")
 *        2:    Eventdata
 *            2.0:    Baseclass of Radio
 *            2.1:    Preset
